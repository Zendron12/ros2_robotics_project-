# ROS2 Robotics Project

This repository contains a complete robotics project developed using **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)**. The project showcases intelligent autonomous system design, integrating navigation, perception, and control within a ROS2 workspace.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `src/` - Source code and ROS2 packages
* `launch/` - Launch files for bringing up the system
* `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration
* `package.xml` - ROS2 package metadata

## 🚀 Features

* ROS2 nodes for robot control and perception
* Launch files for easy startup of the robot system
* Modular design for scalability and reuse
* Compatible with standard ROS2 distributions

## 💡 Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ros2_robotics_project.git
   ```
2. Build the workspace:

   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```
3. Source the setup file:

   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```
4. Launch the system:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch your_package your_launch_file.launch.py
   ```
